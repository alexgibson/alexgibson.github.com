Today marks my third year working for [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org)!
I usually try and put together a short recap on the things I’ve accomplished
during the past year here. There are so many things I could pick out, but I find
it hard to know quite where to begin. Three years seems to have flown by very
quickly, but looking back at the time when I started, I feel like I have grown
considerably. I guess this has been my first year at Mozilla where I no longer
feel “new”, although I am still learning constantly by being surrounded by so
many smart people.

Here are some of my personal highlights (and random stats) from the past year:

- I made over [269 commits](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/commits?author=alexgibson) to [bedrock](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock) (the repository codename for [mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org)). I enjoy working on the site because
it’s high traffic, spans a large code base, and gets translated into a huge
number of languages (now over 100 locales!). During the past year our small
team made big progress paying off technical debt and shaping changes for the
future. We finished migrating away from the old legacy PHP/SVN site, and
finally moved everything over to Python/GitHub. This has taken several years to
complete in itself (amongst other priorities). We also did a ton of
infrastructure work moving the site to [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/), which
being largely a front-end person who is not accustomed to such work, was really
fascinating to watch.

- I have now filed over 280 bugs on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/),
been assigned over 350 bugs, and made over 2700 comments.

- I spent considerable time learning the ins and outs of
[Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) and automated cross-browser testing,
which also required learning more Python. Together with Mozilla’s [WebQA team](https://quality.mozilla.org/teams/web-qa/),
I worked on building an [integration test suite](http://bedrock.readthedocs.org/en/latest/testing.html) for bedrock, which
we now run as part of our new automated [deployment pipeline](http://bedrock.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pipeline.html).

- Continuing my [prior work](https://alxgbsn.co.uk/2015/04/18/my-second-year-working-at-mozilla/) on
Firefox user on-boarding, I got to help build the interactive tour that
demonstrates how Tracking Protection works in the new Firefox [Private Browsing](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/private-browsing/) mode. This is a
feature I’m very proud that Mozilla decided to ship, so I'm really happy I got
help introduce it to a lot of people.

- On the travel front, I got to visit [Whistler](http://www.whistler.com/) in
British Columbia and [Orlando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida)
in Florida for Mozilla all-hands weeks. I find these types of weeks generally
exhausting, but at the same time I feel very privileged to be able to attend
company events on this scale. I don’t think I’ll ever forget
[zip-lining from the top of a mountain](http://www.superflyziplines.com/) with
the rest of my team, or being able to bring my family along to [Disney World](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/) so my son could have an experience
he’ll always remember. I feel hugely appreciative to Mozilla for being able to
share experiences like this with colleagues, friends and family alike.
