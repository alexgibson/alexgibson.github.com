This year I was lucky enough to grab a ticket for [ffconf 2015](http://2015.ffconf.org/)
before it sold out. I missed the boat last year, but I had attended once before
in 2013, so felt confident that it would once again be a worthy pilgrimage to
(not so sunny) Brighton. I always liked that the speakers for ffconf are never
announced ahead of tickets going on sale. Everything boils down to the content
and how talks are curated. Here are my notes from the day:

Robin Mehner - JavaScript that doesnâ€™t hurt your feelings
---------------------------------------------------------

Robin started off the day talking about new shiny features in ES2015, and how
it can help us write nicer, cleaner JavaScript with less boilerplate. He showed
off many code examples highlighting practical every day uses. These are just a
few of the key features he discussed:

* [Template string literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/template_strings).
* [Default parameter values](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters).
* [Rest parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters).
* [Spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator).
* Block scope variables [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) and [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const).
* [Destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).
* [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).
* [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes).

In addition to major new features, Robin took some time to cover some smaller,
lesser talked about bits and pieces that are also very useful:

* [Array.find()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)
* [String.startsWith()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/startsWith)
* [String.endsWith()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/endsWith)
* [String.includes()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/includes)
* [Object.assign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)

Many of these features are already [supported in browsers today](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/), or you can of
course use a transpiler such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to convert your code to ES5.

Sara Soueidan - SVG in motion
-----------------------------

Sara gave a really comprehensive talk on pretty much everything you need to know
about SVG when it comes to animation. She gave a very detailed run through of
all the main embedding techniques, their appropriate fallbacks, and how to choose
the most suitable method depending on what you need to animate. I've done a
little bit of SVG based CSS animation, and I know from bitter experience just
how many pitfalls there can be to get things to work cross-browser. I still don't
think I truly understand everything I need to know when it comes to properties like
`viewbox`, but Sara's talk was especially useful in helping to explain things more
clearly. She also went on to give demos of other interesting techniques that I
had not seen before, such as SVG Sprite Animation and 'repsonsive' SVG animation
based on viewport size.

Anna Shipman - Operations: a developer's guide
----------------------------------------------

Anna gave a really useful talk on operations aimed at developers, explaining the
difference between concepts such as *virtualization* and *containerization*.
She covered weird sounding terms such as [*hypervisor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor), and explained the differences between tools such as
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)/[Otto](https://ottoproject.io/) and
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Anna also gave some great examples of using simple Unix command line tools such
as `make`, which can quite easily do many of the common build tasks we often
leave to NPM/Gulp/Grunt.

John K. Paul - The Web Audio Phenomenon that Shall Not Be Named
---------------------------------------------------------------

John talked about his interests in both programming and linguistics. Both
have their own syntax and semantics, but natural languages can have different
kinds of semantics depending on the sentence. Programming is more like a set
instruction. Natural languages can also have pragmatics, something which does not
exist in code. For example, what might a person have been thinking when they
conveyed a sentence to another person? How could computers accomplish this
understanding?

John went on to give a demo of a [website he made](https://makemcgurk.com/) to
highlight something called the [McGurk effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGurk_effect).
He used Web API's such as `getUserMedia`, `Web Audio`, and the [Media Recorder API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder_API)
to build a Node app that lets people record their own McGurk videos to share with
friends.

Marcy Sutton - How to win at mobile accessibility
-------------------------------------------------

Marcy gave a talk on mobile web accessibility, covering common barriers to
accessibility on mobile and how we can overcome them to help build more inclusive
experiences for everyone.

Common accessibility barriers include:

* Preventing pinch/zoom.
* Scroll highjacking.
* Ambiguous icons without labels.
* Conflicting gestures such as swipe.

Marcy noted that mobile web browsers often have much spottier ARIA support
compared to their desktop counterparts, and as such the most used button for
a11y on mobile websites is often the *reader mode* button. This is what we're
competing against! She then went on to demo several websites on iOS using
VoiceOver, pointing out common accessibility issues and how to fix them.
Marcy also covered things such as the importance of semantics, touch target
sizing, tab order, and making sure that hidden content is reachable.

Useful resources for accessibility include:

* [BBC Mobile Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/mobile)
* [Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/design/practice#toolkit)

Paul Lewis - You should use <insert library/framework>, it's the bestestest!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paul talked about the [cost of using JavaScript frameworks](https://aerotwist.com/blog/the-cost-of-frameworks/), a follow up to
his earlier blog post about [React performance](https://aerotwist.com/blog/react-plus-performance-equals-what/).
He conducted several tests using popular JavaScript frameworks
and [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) as a common baseline, and emphasized that
developers should stop taking the latest or most popular frameworks to be
*silver bullets*. Every framework has best practices that need to be followed.
This can be especially true when it comes to mobile devices, where both time to
first paint and interaction can be so crucial. The bottom line is that *all
code has a cost*, and we must consider that what is good for developers needs
can't justifiably outweigh the needs of users.

Paul also gave a demo of a new project he's been working on called [Big Rig](https://aerotwist.com/blog/bigrig/), which gives automated load and
scroll performance analysis for websites. I would love to see this working in
Firefox soon as well as Chrome!

Martin Kleppe - Code Calligrams
-------------------------------

Martin gave a really interesting talk about both the art and the technique that
goes into making code [calligrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calligram).
I've always been aware of these types of things superficially, but never took
the time to understand how they are constructed. Very clever stuff, and most
definitely something that I'd like to spend some time learning more about.

Code calligram examples:

* [aem1k.com](http://aem1k.com/)
* [jsfuck.com](http://www.jsfuck.com/)

Lena Reinhard - A Talk about Everything
---------------------------------------

The last presentation of the day was from Lena, who gave a very honest, powerful
and sometimes uncomfortable talk about the challenges many people face every day
in the software industry. I tried to put together some words here that might do
the talk justice, but everything I tried to write down fell short of hitting home.
You should just go watch the video instead (you could hear a pin drop in the venue).
