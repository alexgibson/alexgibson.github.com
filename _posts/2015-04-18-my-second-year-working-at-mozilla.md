desc: A look back at my second year working at Mozilla

This week marked my second year Mozillaversary. I did plan to write this blog post of the 15th April, which would have marked the day I started, but this week flew by so quickly I almost completely missed it!

Contributions
-------------

Carrying on from [last years blog post](http://alxgbsn.co.uk/2014/04/15/my-first-year-working-at-mozilla/), much of my second year at Mozilla has been spent working on various parts of [www.mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org), to which I made a total of [196 commits](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/commits?author=alexgibson) this year.

Firefox on-boarding
-------------------

Much of my time has been spent working on Firefox on-boarding. Following the success of the on-boarding flow we built for the [Firefox 29 Australis redesign](https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2014/03/introducing-the-update-experience-for-australis/) last year, I went on to work on several more on-boarding flows to help introduce new features in Firefox. This included a UITour for the newly rebranded [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/) firstrun experience, as well as updates to the existing Firefox tour for new features such as the [refined search UI](https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2014/11/find-it-faster/) and [Firefox Hello](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/hello/).

Firefox Hello FTU
-----------------

As well as all these browser tour updates, I also got to work on the first time user experience (FTU) for when a user makes their [first Firefox Hello video call](http://hollyhabstritt.com/blog/2015/1/18/your-first-hello). This was another UITour page that communicated with Hello and guided users through how to use the feature. It was all a *crazy* amount of work from a lot of different people, but something I really enjoyed getting to work on alongside various other teams at Mozilla.

Mozilla homepage
----------------

In between all that I also got to work on some other cool things, including the 2015 [www.mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org) homepage redesign. Something I consider quite a privilege!

All-hands and work weeks
------------------------

On the travel front, I got to visit both San Fransisco and Santa Clara a bunch more times (I'm kind of losing count now). I also got to visit Portland for the first time when Mozilla had their all-hands week last December, which was such a great city!

I'm looking forward to whatever year three has in store!
