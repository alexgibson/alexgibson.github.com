Today marks my first year Mozillaversary, which is pretty hard to believe! I feel very fortunate to work at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org), as I get to work with a very [talented bunch of people](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev/Web_Production). The last 12 months have flown by and it's pretty hard to put it all into a single blog post, so I thought I would try and put things into perspective using some simple statistics (hooray for open work flow and bug trackers!).

Over the past 365 days I have:

* Contributed to a total of 5 Mozilla projects/websites.
* Made over [118 commits](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/commits?author=alexgibson) to [www.mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org).
* Made over [31 commits](https://github.com/mozilla/remo/commits?author=alexgibson) to [reps.mozilla.org](https://reps.mozilla.org)
* On [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/) I have filed 39 bugs, been assigned 94 bugs and commented on 254 bugs.

Looking past the numbers, I have got to work on some pretty [interesting projects](https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2014/03/introducing-the-update-experience-for-australis/) and built some cool things to help visualize Mozilla's world wide [community of contributors](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/communities/).

I was lucky enough to spend some time visiting a bunch of different places, including Mozilla's offices in [Toronto](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/toronto/), [San Francisco](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/san-francisco/) and [Mountain View](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/mountain-view/) (Ironically, I  have yet to visit the London office!). I also got to attend the [Mozilla Summit](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2013) in Brussels, where I got to meet and hang out with lots of other [Mozillians](https://mozillians.org/en-US/). I also managed to squeeze in a quick trip to sunny ol’ Blighty for [Full Frontal](http://2013.full-frontal.org/). It was all a blast.

I'm looking forward to the next 365 days and what they have to offer. Mozilla is a great community to be part of, it's more than just a “cool” company to work for. I think Mozilla's [mission](http://www.mozilla.org/mission/) is pretty important right now, so it feels good to be a small part of it.
