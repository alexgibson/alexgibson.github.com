    <p>
        I'm Alex Gibson, a front&ndash;end developer living in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. My area of expertise is mainly around front end development, and technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As well as blogging about web development here, I also maintain several open source projects over on <a href="https://github.com/alexgibson">GitHub</a>. I also help out as a co-maintainer on <a href="http://mobileboilerplate.com">Mobile Boilerplate</a>.

    <h2>The site</h2>

    <p>
        The purpose of this site is mainly to publish my thoughts on development and serve as point of contact for projects I work on. It is by no means the best looking site in the world, but it serves its purpose of being easy to read and maintain. In terms of the technologies used, it is a simple static site built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and is hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. It uses <a href="http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/">Normalize.css</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a> to author the CSS. That's it.
