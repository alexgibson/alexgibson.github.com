<p>My name is Alex Gibson and I'm a Front-End Developer living in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. I currently work for <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. I'm passionate about the open web, and have experience working on large-scale projects. I like to make fast websites that anyone can use.</p>

<p>When I'm not writing code, I like to spend time with my family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, ride bikes 🚴, brew fancy coffee ☕, and play video games 🕹.</p>
