This is the source code repository for my [personal blog](https://alxgbsn.co.uk), a simple static site built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub pages.

Install
-------

First install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

```
gem install bundler
```

Site dependencies can then be installed using:

```
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
```

Finally install dev dependencies from npm:

```
npm install
```

Run
---

To compile the static site, start the local dev server and watch for changes:

```
npm run serve
```

Build
-----

To just compile the static site:

```
npm run build
```

Test
-----

Once the static site has been generated you can then validate the HTML and all site links by running:

```
npm run test
```
