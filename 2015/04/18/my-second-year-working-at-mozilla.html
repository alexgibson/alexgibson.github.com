I did plan to write this blog post of the 15th April, which would have marked the day I started, but this week flew by so quickly I almost completely missed it!</p><h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2><p>Carrying on from <a href="http://alxgbsn.co.uk/2014/04/15/my-first-year-working-at-mozilla/">last years blog post</a>, most of my second year at Mozilla has been spent working on various parts of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">www.mozilla.org</a>, to which I made a total of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/commits?author=alexgibson">196 commits</a> this year.</p><h2 id="firefox-on-boarding">Firefox on-boarding</h2><p>Much of my time has been spent working on Firefox on-boarding. Following the success of the on-boarding flow we built for the Firefox 29 Australis redesign <a href="https://alxgbsn.co.uk/2014/04/15/my-first-year-working-at-mozilla/">last year</a>, I went on to work on several more on-boarding flows to help introduce new features in Firefox. This included a UITour for the newly rebranded <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/">Firefox Developer Edition</a> /firstrun experience, as well as updates to the existing Firefox tour for new features such as the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2014/11/find-it-faster/">refined search UI</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/hello/">Firefox Hello</a>.</p><figure><img src="/images/posts/dev-edition-firstrun.png" alt="Screenshot of Firefox Developer Edition /firstrun tour page" srcset="/images/posts/dev-edition-firstrun-high-res.png 1.5x"><figcaption>Firefox Developer Edition /firstrun tour page</figcaption></figure><h2 id="firefox-hello-ftu">Firefox Hello FTU</h2><p>Because of the UITour experience I have gained, I also got pulled in to work on the first time user experience (FTU) for when a user makes their <a href="http://hollyhabstritt.com/blog/2015/1/18/your-first-hello">first Firefox Hello video call</a>. Hello is a new feature in Firefox that enables real time video chat via WebRTC.</p><figure><img src="/images/posts/firefox-hello-screenshot.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Firefox Hello" srcset="/images/posts/firefox-hello-screenshot-high-res.jpg 1.5x"><figcaption>Firefox Hello</figcaption></figure><p>The FTU was another UITour page that communicated with Hello, guiding users through how to use the feature to make their first video call. It was all a <em>crazy</em> amount of work from a lot of different people, but something I really enjoyed getting to work on alongside various other teams at Mozilla.</p><h2 id="mozilla-homepage">Mozilla homepage</h2><p>Outside of Firefox oriented work, I also got to work on the redesigned 2015 <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">www.mozilla.org</a> homepage. Being the main front-page that represents Mozilla and what we do, this is something I consider quite a privilege to work on.</p><figure><img src="/images/posts/homepage.png" alt="Screenshot of Mozilla 2015 homepage" srcset="/images/posts/homepage-high-res.png 1.5x"><figcaption>Mozilla 2015 homepage</figcaption></figure><h2 id="all-hands-and-work-weeks">All-hands and work weeks</h2><p>On the travel front, I got to visit both San Fransisco and Santa Clara a bunch more times (I’m kind of losing count now). I also got to visit Portland for the first time when Mozilla had their all-hands week last December, which was such a great city to spend time in.</p><p>I’m looking forward to whatever year three has in store!</p></section></article><footer role="contentinfo"><form role="search" class="search" action="https://duckduckgo.com/" method="get" title="Search this site"><label for="q">Search</label> <input type="hidden" name="sites" value="alxgbsn.co.uk"> <input class="search" type="search" name="q" id="q" placeholder="Search this site"> <button type="submit">Go</button></form><ul><li><a href="/feed/index.xml" title="RSS feed">Subscribe (RSS)</a></li></ul></footer></main><script type="module" src="/assets/main-058dcf1c5b2815b57e44c7ed387fe85f37926b180e1c41b60110ce86ad4e290d.js"></script></body></html>
