    <p>I've just finished moving my site to a new home, which is now hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the increasingly popular static site generator. Jekyll takes a template directory and then processes it to create a static website consisting of pure HTML files, which you can then host on your chosen web server.</p>

<p>For the past few years my old blog has served me pretty well, but I've been looking for something simpler and less cumbersome to update and maintain. Here are a list of reasons why I made the decision to choose Jekyll:</p>

<h2>Authoring new content</h2>

<p>No more bloated CMS or WYSIWYG editors! I can write draft content using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, which can be processed directly by Jekyll. With cross-device apps like <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">Ai Writer</a> and cloud syncing via <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> or <a href="https://www.icloud.com/">iCloud</a>, creating draft content while on the move is now incredibly easy.</p>

<h2>Built-in version control</h2>

<p>Because this site is hosted on GitHub, version control comes baked-in. I use one branch (master) for hosting the static site on GitHub Pages, and another (admin) for the source.</p>

<h2>Performance &amp; reliability</h2>

<p>No more PHP/MySQL database means pages load faster and the site should be able to handle periods of heavy traffic with less worry.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Having to deal with mySQL security issues should be unnecessary for something as simple as a personal website or blog. Now I no longer even need think about it.</p>

<h2>Collaboration</h2>

<p>Because the <a href="https://github.com/alexgibson/alexgibson.github.com">source</a> for this site is available on GitHub, people are free to make suggestions and/or corrections to my posts via submitting a pull request or opening an issue.</p>

<h2>Portability</h2>

<p>Moving a static site to a new web server in the future couldn't be simpler. I also still retain the original content in markdown format, instead of being locked away inside a database file.</p>

<h2>Plugins</h2>

<p>There are a wealth of good <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Plugins">Jekyll plugins</a> available via the community. Jekyll also works very nicely with the Python syntax highlighter <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a>, which you can see in use on this site.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>So far, I'm really enjoying the simplicity of having a static site. Getting Jekyll up and running correctly was initially a little confusing, but it was actually quite simple once I got to it. I'm still learning a lot about making the most out of my template structure, as there is still a lot I need to explore. The new site is by no means complete, and there are still a few things I have yet to work out how do. But I'm pretty happy with what I've managed to put together in just a couple of days.</p>
