I usually try and put together a short recap on the things I’ve accomplished during the past year here. There are so many things I could pick out, but I find it hard to know quite where to begin. Three years have flown by very quickly, but looking back at the time when I started, I feel like I have grown considerably. I guess this has been my first year at Mozilla where I no longer feel “new”, although I am still learning constantly by being surrounded by so many smart people.</p><p>Here are some of my personal highlights (and random stats) from the past year.</p><h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2><p>I made over <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/commits?author=alexgibson">269 commits</a> to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock">bedrock</a> (the repository codename for <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">www.mozilla.org</a>). I enjoy working on the site because it’s high traffic, spans a large code base, and gets translated into a huge number of languages (now over 100 locales). It also has it’s own little place in internet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q7FTjhvZ7Y">history</a>, which I think is kinda cool.</p><p>During the past year our small team made big progress paying off technical debt and shaping changes for the future. We finished migrating away from the old legacy PHP/SVN site, and finally moved everything over to Python/GitHub. This has taken several years to complete in itself (amongst other priorities). We also did a ton of infrastructure work moving the site to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, which being largely a front-end person who is not accustomed to such work, was really fascinating to watch.</p><p>I have now filed over 280 bugs on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>, been assigned over 350 bugs, and made over 2700 comments.</p><h2 id="continuous-integration-and-functional-testing">Continuous integration and functional testing</h2><p>I spent considerable time learning all about <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> and automated cross-browser testing, which also required learning more Python. Together with Mozilla’s <a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/teams/web-qa/">WebQA team</a>, I worked on building an <a href="http://bedrock.readthedocs.org/en/latest/testing.html">integration test suite</a> for bedrock, which we now run as part of our new <a href="http://bedrock.readthedocs.org/en/latest/pipeline.html">automated deployment pipeline</a>. This was a real learning curve for me being primarily a front-end developer, but something that I think has helped broaden my skills.</p><h2 id="tracking-protection">Tracking Protection</h2><p>Continuing my <a href="https://alxgbsn.co.uk/2015/04/18/my-second-year-working-at-mozilla/">prior work</a> on Firefox user on-boarding, I got to help build the interactive tour that demonstrates how Tracking Protection works in the new Firefox <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/private-browsing/">Private Browsing</a> mode.</p><figure><img src="/images/posts/tracking-protection-tour.png" alt="Screenshot of Firefox Tracking Protection tour page" srcset="/images/posts/tracking-protection-tour-high-res.png 1.5x"><figcaption>Tracking Protection tour page</figcaption></figure><p>This is a feature I’m very proud that Mozilla decided to ship, so I’m really happy we got to help introduce it to a lot of people updating their Firefox via a /whatsnew page.</p><figure><img src="/images/posts/tracking-protection-whatsnew.png" alt="Screenshot of Firefox /whatsnew page" srcset="/images/posts/tracking-protection-whatsnew-high-res.png 1.5x"><figcaption>Firefox /whatsnew page</figcaption></figure><h2 id="all-hands-weeks">All-hands weeks</h2><p>On the travel front, I got to visit <a href="http://www.whistler.com/">Whistler</a> in British Columbia and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida">Orlando</a> in Florida for Mozilla all-hands weeks. I find these types of weeks generally exhausting, but at the same time I feel very privileged to be able to attend company events on this scale. I don’t think I’ll ever forget <a href="http://www.superflyziplines.com/">zip-lining from the top of a mountain</a> with the rest of my team, or being able to bring my family along to <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/">Disney World</a> so my son could have an experience he’ll always remember.</p><figure><img src="/images/posts/zip-line-whistler.jpg" alt="Our team preparing to zip-line from the top of a mountain!"><figcaption>Our team getting ready to zip-line!</figcaption></figure><p>I feel hugely appreciative to Mozilla for being able to share experiences like this with colleagues, friends and family alike.</p><p class="scroll-to-top"><a href="#top">Scroll to top</a></p></section></article><footer role="contentinfo"><form role="search" class="search" action="https://duckduckgo.com/" method="get" title="Search this site"><label for="q">Search</label> <input type="hidden" name="sites" value="alxgbsn.co.uk"> <input class="search" type="search" name="q" id="q" placeholder="Search this site"> <button type="submit">Go</button></form><ul><li><a href="/feed/index.xml" title="RSS feed">Subscribe (RSS)</a></li></ul></footer></main><script type="module" src="/assets/theme-77026091a174da81bd4e08d59206f16043046cb6f5d13d856dfc667c7d57987b.js"></script><script type="module" src="/assets/main-e720254e216df6f38df9183d48fc5096b498cf7aa00bfdf57bf8aa71c31a7980.js"></script></body></html>
